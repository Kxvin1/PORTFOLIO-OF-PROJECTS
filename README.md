  * **Description:**  This project that I quickly wrote because I wanted to learn web scraping because of a future project I plan on creating that utilizes data from Amazon.

There is also the option to only scrape the ASINs.

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Kxvin1/log_parser
  * **Description:**  This project that I created because I wanted to learn how to receive large amounts of data and format that data into a CSV file. This is a Python script that parses a log file and finds users' geographical location from the IP address, as well as user agent information, and other similar data and converts that data into a csv.
  Some challenges I faced was refactoring my code because the way I was receiving and organizing the data at first was not optimal. I solved it by putting in the files into an array and then storing the data of each log in an object. I would then loop through the array by their index and extract the needed data that way.
  [Click Here](https://github.com/Kxvin1/log_parser/blob/main/main.py) to see the code and how the script was implemented.
  * **Tools:**  Python, Docker
